				<h2><i>What is C Programming Langauge? </i> </h2>
				<div class="lau"><p>C is a general-purpose programming language that is extremely popular, simple, and flexible to use. It is a structured programming language that is machine-independent and extensively used to write various applications, Operating Systems like Windows, and many other complex programs like Oracle database, Git, Python interpreter, and more.</p>

                <p>It is said that ‘C’ is a god’s programming language. One can say, C is a base for the programming. If you know ‘C,’ you can easily grasp the knowledge of the other programming languages that uses the concept of ‘C’</p>

				<h2><i> Why C langauge ?</i></h2>
				<div class="lau"><ol>
					<li>As a middle-level language, C combines the features of both high-level and low-level languages. It can be used for low-level programming, such as scripting for drivers and kernels and it also supports functions of high-level programming languages, such as scripting for software applications etc.</li>
					<li>C is a structured programming language which allows a complex program to be broken into simpler programs called functions. It also allows free movement of data across these functions.</li>
					<li>C is highly portable and is used for scripting system applications which form a major part of Windows, UNIX, and Linux operating system.</li>
					<li>C is a general-purpose programming language and can efficiently work on enterprise applications, games, graphics, and applications requiring calculations, etc.</li>
					<li>C language has a rich library which provides a number of built-in functions. It also offers dynamic memory allocation</li>
					<li>C implements algorithms and data structures swiftly, facilitating faster computations in programs. This has enabled the use of C in applications requiring higher degrees of calculations like MATLAB and Mathematica.</li>
